Cleaning a stack of dishes could be organized with a stack data structure. You would have to clean the last dishes put into the sink first.
INIT dirtyDishStack to an empty array
SET dirtyDishStack[INDEX] to pan
SET dirtyDishStack[INDEX] to plate
SET dirtyDishStack[INDEX] to bowl
SET dirtyDishStack[INDEX] to spoon
SET dirtyDishStack[INDEX] to fork
FUNCTION cleanDishes(dirtyDishStack)
	FOR each dish in dirtyDishStack
		POP dirtyDishStack
	END FOR
END FUNCTION

3. My data structure allows developers to access and manipulate the data because they could easily add and remove data based on any given circumstances surrounding the sink of dishes as well as my data structure being clearly worded so the function of it is obvious.
